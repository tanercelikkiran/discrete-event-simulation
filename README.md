# Discrete Event Simulation of a Coffee Shop

## Description

This is a discrete event simulation of the HUCS Coffee Shop. It is written in native C++. It is the third project assignment for the course BBM203 - Data Structures at Hacettepe University, Fall 2022. The main purpose of this project is to learn the basics of discrete event simulation and to practice the use of queues and priority queues. One sample input file and one sample output file are provided in the project directory. You can use any input file you want, but the format of the input file must be the same as the sample input file.
Details of the project can be found in the project description file.

## Requirements

The project is written in C++ and uses the C++ standard library. It's compiled with GNU GCC 11.2.0. It should be compatible with any C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later. Makefile is required to compile the project.

## How to run

First of all, clone the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanercelikkiran/discrete-event-simulation.git
```

To compile the project, run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
make
make clean
```

To run the simulation, run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
./Assignment3 <input_file_path> <output_file_path>
```
